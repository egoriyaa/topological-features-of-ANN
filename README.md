# topological-features-of-ANN

### The task of my diploma is to research topological properties of fully connected neural networks in classification tasks on classic datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10. 

The first step is to correctly convert neurons and weights into weighted graph and check the number of vertices and edges.
