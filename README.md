# Topological-features-of-ANN

#### The task of my thesis is to research topological properties of fully connected neural networks in classification tasks on classic datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10. [Here](https://www.hse.ru/edu/vkr/624081751) you can find the full text of this paper. 

This repository contains both initial constructing of a weighted graph from a neuron network in .ipynb as a first step in the work and final realizations of essential methods
